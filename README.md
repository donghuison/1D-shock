# 1D Shock Propagation Simulation

This project simulates the propagation of a shock wave using various numerical methods, including the Lax-Wendroff, MacCormack, MUSCL, Roe, and Roe-FDS. The code also includes the implementation of the application of artificial viscosity to improve numerical stability.
